# Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (PAL) — Xbox to PC port

A native Windows port of the original Xbox game *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone* (2003), made by
**static recompilation**: the game's x86 code is translated to C and compiled for Windows, with the Xbox kernel,
Direct3D 8, DirectSound and input replaced by native code. No emulator.

Features beyond the original: resolutions up to 4K with MSAA/SMAA and anisotropic filtering, true 16:9
(widened 3D, 2D kept in shape), windowed/borderless/fullscreen, keyboard and mouse with rebinding, controller
remapping, deadzones and vibration strength, colour-blind correction filters, a 30 fps cap or unlocked frame
rate, and "Quit To Desktop" in the game's menus.

**This repository contains no game content.** To play or build it you need the files from your own copy of the
Xbox disc. The build regenerates the recompiled code from your `default.xbe`.

## Playing

Download the repository, build the executables and put your disc's files or the .xiso in a `game` folder beside the executables and start
`hppoa_launcher.exe`. Requirements, controls and every option are in [port/README.txt](port/README.txt).

## Building

See [port/DEVELOPING.md](port/DEVELOPING.md): MSYS2 (UCRT64) setup, regenerating the code from the XBE, building,
debugging tools and how the port works.
